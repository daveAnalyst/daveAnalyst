# Hi, I'm David Angaya! 👋

I'm a Junior AI/ML Engineer based in Nairobi, Kenya, passionate about leveraging machine learning and generative AI to solve real-world problems in healthcare, fintech, and beyond. With a background in economics and a transition to data science, I bring a unique blend of analytical thinking and technical expertise to my projects.

### 🔧 What I Do
- Build predictive ML models and GenAI solutions for diverse domains (healthcare, fintech, sports analytics).
- Develop production-ready APIs with CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployment.
- Create conversational AI systems to enhance user experiences (e.g., multilingual chatbots).
- Contribute to open-source projects and share my learning journey on Kaggle (500+ views on my PCA notebook!).

### 🌟 Featured Projects
- **[SwiftCareAI](https://devpost.com/davidomungala3)**: A healthcare decision support prototype for triage in high-pressure environments, built during the Google GenAI Hackathon 2025 (top-5 finish).
- **[March Madness Mania 2025](https://github.com/DaveAnalyst/march-mania-2025-v2)**: A TensorFlow-based prediction engine for NCAA basketball outcomes, achieving an OOF Brier score of 0.25.
- **Coming Soon**: A fintech credit risk prediction API and a multilingual customer support chatbot using Hugging Face!
